    <h1><b>Pitchboard</b></h1>

    <h2><b>Title: </b>Sara's Portfolio</h2>

    <h2><b>Short Pitch</b></h2>
    <p>
        This website is intended to showcase all my work 
        as an artist and content creator, as well as a method 
        to contact me.
    </p>

    <h2><b>Long Pitch</b></h2>
    <p>
        I'm currently a double major at MSU. My goal with this website
        is to showcase all my work in the creative field, with active
        links to some of my films. Other visual content would be my 
        photography. In addition to the visual content I'd showcase I'd also
        like to have a page specifically for myself where I'd introduce
        myself and give a face to a name and provide links to my Instagram,
        LinkedIn, Facebook page, and YouTube Channels. The last page I'd have 
        would be a contact me page which would provide a link to my email.
